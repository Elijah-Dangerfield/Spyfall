    <string name="string_rules">Spyfall is a party game
        unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to
        understand what\'s going on around you. It\'s really simple! Spyfall is played over
        several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same
        location — a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one
        player receives a card that says "Spy" instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions
        — "Why are you dressed so strangely?" or "When was the last time we got a payday?" or anything else you can come
        up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn\'t know where he is, so he has to listen
        carefully.
        When it\'s his time to answer, he\'d better create a good story!

        After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored
        the most points is victorious! This party game makes neurotic suspicions fun!
